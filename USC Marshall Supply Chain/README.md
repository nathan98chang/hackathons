Conceived at USC Marshall Supply Chain's 2017 Digital Transformation Hackathon.

This project uses Java packages, python scripts, and the iOS SDK to periodically
generate scheduling data for thousands of cargo containers that enter and exit
shipping ports.

This project was made with Ed Arenberg and Dakarai McCoy. I handled the presentation
and python scripts utilized to convert the input data to a usable format.
