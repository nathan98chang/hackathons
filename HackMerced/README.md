Grub Club

Conceived at HackMerced 2017, won "Best in Show" award

Used Apple's iOS SDK, Google's Places API, and ML based algorithms to create an pplication that allows users to
choose friends to eat with and receive a restaurant suggestion based on previous user restaurant ratings,
trends in visiting habits, and overall mutual likes.

This project was made with Brendan Wong, Abhi Arya, Julius Fan, and Jay Minakhom.
My work was on the front-end interface (Grub Club v3). I broke my laptop this weekend
and used multiple friends' computers, as such, some of the xcode user data is linked to different
people.
